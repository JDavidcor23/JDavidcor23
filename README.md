Web developer with knowledge in Reactjs, Nodejs, tailwindcss, and typescript, I am always looking to learn and improve my skills. I have a passion for technology and love staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the field.

I am also a strong believer in the power of feedback and am always open to hearing from others about how I can improve.

In addition to my technical skills, I also have a keen interest in web 3 technologies and am always looking for opportunities to learn more about this exciting area of development. I believe that the combination of my technical expertise and my passion for learning make me an asset to any team.
